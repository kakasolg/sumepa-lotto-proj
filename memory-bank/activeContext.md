## Next Steps (Target: 80% MVP completion)

### 1. Number Selection Interface (Priority 1)
- **Target:** Interactive grid for lottery number selection
- **Components needed:**
  - Selected numbers display with visual feedback
  - Number grid (game-specific ranges: Powerball 1-69+1-26, etc.)
  - "Let Mido Pick" quick selection with AJAX
  - "Favorite Set" simulation button
  - "Add to Cart" state management with session storage

### 2. Shopping Cart & Checkout Flow (Priority 2)
- **Target:** Complete purchase simulation with transparent fees
- **Features needed:**
  - Cart review screen with itemized tickets
  - Order & fee breakdown (service fee 20%, processing fee $1)
  - Cart persistence across navigation using Flask sessions
  - Quantity management and item removal
  - ACH-only payment method simulation

### 3. Tickets Management (Priority 3)
- **Target:** Complete ticket lifecycle demonstration
- **Status system:** Active â†’ Checked â†’ Archived
- **UI sections:** "Upcoming Draws" and "Past Results"
- **Features:** Automatic status updates, winning simulation

### 4. Account Management (Priority 4)
- **Target:** Complete user account interface
- **Features:** Profile display, wallet management links, help/support
- **Polish:** Error pages (404, 500) and enhanced validation

## Session Goals
- **Immediate:** Complete number selection interface (2-3 hours)
- **Secondary:** Implement shopping cart flow (2-3 hours)
- **Stretch:** Add tickets management (1-2 hours)
- **Target completion:** 80% MVP by session end

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Technical Decisions
- **Data persistence:** Continuing with session-based storage for rapid prototyping
- **Authentication:** Maintaining demo account system (demo@lottogo.com / demo123)
- **Styling approach:** Leveraging Tailwind CSS utilities for consistency
- **Mobile-first:** All new components designed for mobile first

### UX/UI Considerations
- **Number selection UX:** Make grid intuitive with clear selection feedback
- **Cart visibility:** Ensure users always know cart status
- **Compliance messaging:** Maintain legal disclaimers throughout flow
- **Error handling:** Plan for validation feedback and error states

### Business Logic Focus
- **Fee transparency:** Always show service (20%) and processing ($1) fees clearly
- **Verification gate:** First-purchase identity verification simulation
- **Payment flow:** ACH-only enforcement throughout checkout

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Code Organization
- Single Flask app file (`app.py`) for prototype simplicity
- Template inheritance using `base.html` master layout
- Mock data separated in `mockdata.py` for easy management
- Session-based state management using Flask sessions

### Design System Usage
- **Colors:** LottoGo Blue (#1e40af), Gold (#f59e0b), Green (#10b981), Red (#ef4444)
- **Typography:** Inter font family throughout
- **Effects:** Subtle glassmorphism and gradients for modern look
- **Responsive:** Mobile-first with min-width breakpoints

### Component Patterns
- Game cards with consistent structure (name, jackpot, draw date, CTA)
- Bottom navigation for mobile, tab navigation for desktop
- Form styling with Tailwind utilities and validation feedback
- Hover effects and smooth transitions for interactivity

## Learnings and Project Insights

### What's Working Exceptionally Well
- **Design consistency:** Tailwind CSS enabling rapid, professional styling
- **Mobile-first approach:** Perfect responsive behavior across all screen sizes
- **Session management:** Flask sessions handling authentication and state flawlessly
- **Mock data strategy:** Easy to modify, test, and demonstrate different scenarios
- **User experience:** Smooth, professional feel that builds confidence
- **Code organization:** Clean Flask structure scaling well as features are added

### Technical Insights Gained
- **Flask routing:** Simple structure enabling very quick feature addition
- **Template inheritance:** Base template pattern scaling perfectly
